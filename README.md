This is the recipes project for the Odin Project.

This project was used to practice basic HTML formatting; including using headers, bold and italic text, adding images, working links, and using paragraphs.

Unforutunately, my internet service prevented me from cloning regularly, and I had to upload it all at once.

While doing this project, I found that I was having trouble with inserting images and links, and was able to go over what I missed the first time I went through the lesson. With the added practice of uploading to github, I found this lesson well worth the time.
